		<h3>How to Tap Hear</h3>
		
		<em>Click the 'X' above to close this menu when you're ready to get started.</em>

		<ul>
			<li>Find a quiet place for listening.</li>
			<li>Enter sounds you hear in the "type here" box and tap the "tap here" button (or press return) to add the sound to the word cloud.</li>
			<li>If you hear the same sound, you can enter it again in the "type here" box or simply tap the word in the word cloud. The word will get bigger to indicate you've heard it more.</li>
			<li>Repeat until done.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Other Ways to Tap Hear</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Sit in a noisy place, acclimate yourself to the space, then listen for sounds that stand out.</li>
			<li>Listen for new sounds in an unfamiliar space.</li>
			<li>Listen in a familiar place, to hear what you've been missing.</li>
			<li>Write down everything you hear on your morning commute (assuming you're not driving...). Try it again in the evening.</li>
			<li>Listen for one minute and then write down as many sounds as you can remember.</li>
			<li>Instead of using words, write all sounds as onomatopoeias.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Background</h3>
		
		<p>The genesis of Tap Hear is rooted in a listening exercise I learned as an undergraduate studying music [redacted] years ago. At some point I was exposed to, or perhaps assigned, this task designed to open one’s ears to environmental sound.</p>

		<p>Its effect on me was much more profound than I imagined it would be when I first sat down to try it. I found a nice place in the UC San Diego undergraduate library, got out my notebook and pencil, and prepared to sit and write down everything I heard for 15 minutes. I figured that would be plenty of time, but instead the experience was so unexpectedly interesting and enjoyable that I found myself wanting to continue after the time was up.</p>
		
		<p>It’s hard to put myself in my state of mind from back then. I was young and just getting exposed to new worlds of interesting and unexpected music. It was music that sounded like nothing I had been exposed to growing up (this was long before the internet would provide easy access to the long tail of the music world and visits to Tower records could only take you so far...).  Musician philosophers like Pauline Oliveros and John Cage were telling me to listen to the world around me, and after doing this exercise, I realized that that was a great idea!</p>
		
		<p>For years I’ve looked back fondly on this formative experience, but I couldn’t remember exactly where it came from. Though I knew (or at least was pretty sure) it was from the writings of Pauline Oliveros, the exact source was lost to me until recently, when some helpful Facebook friends were able to quickly point me in the right direction.<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> The instructions were simple:</p>
		
		<blockquote>
			Listen to the environment for 15 minutes or a longer but pre-determined time length.<br>
			Use a timer, clock or any adequate method to define this time length.<br>
			Describe in detail the sounds you hear (heard) and how you feel (felt) about them.<br>
			Include internal as well as external sounds.<br>
			You are part of the environment.<br>
			Explore the limits of audibility:<br>
			(highest, lowest, loudest, softest, most complex, nearest, most distant, longest, shortest sound)
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>That’s it. Just listen attentively in order to bring sounds that we generally ignore into focus. It turns out, when you give those sounds your attention, they become interesting.</p>
		
		<p>There’s a good argument to be made that Tap Hear is technological overkill. All you really need is a pen and paper (or just your favorite notes app on your phone). Nevertheless, I’ve found it to be a useful tool that encourages me to spend some quiet time listening, and I hope that you will too. Either way, just find yourself a quiet space, and enjoy the music.</p>
